            <p>Coffee is a popular beverage that researchers have studied extensively for its many health benefits, including its ability to increase energy levels, promote weight management, enhance athletic performance, and protect against chronic disease. The caffeine in coffee has been found in animal and cell studies to protect cells in the brain that produce dopamine. In a large prospective cohort of more than 500,000 people followed for 10 years, an association was found between drinking higher amounts of coffee and lower rates of death from all causes.</p>

            <h1>Types of Coffee Beans</h1><br>
            <dl>
                <dt><b>1. Arabica Coffee Beans (Coffea arabica)</b></dt>
                <dd>Arabica beans are by far the most popular type of coffee beans, making up about 60% of the world's coffee. These tasty beans originated many centuries ago in the highlands of Ethiopia, and may even be the first coffee beans ever consumed! The name Arabica likely comes from the beans' popularity in 7th-century Arabia (present-day Yemen).</dd>
                <dt><b>2. Robusta Coffee Beans (Coffea caniphora)</b></dt>
                <dd>The second most popular type of coffee bean is Robusta. This bean originated in sub-Saharan Africa and is now grown primarily in Africa and Indonesia. It's also particularly popular in Vietnam and is often mixed into coffee blends. It's a less expensive variety, making it a very budget-friendly choice for roasters.</dd>
                <dt><b>3. Liberica Coffee Beans (Coffea liberica)</b></dt>
                <dd>Native to central and western Africa - specifically Liberia, hence its name - Coffea liberica is prized for its piquant floral aroma and bold, smoky flavor profile. This hardy species is frequently mixed with other varieties to add body and complexity, but rarely receives any credit. Unheard of in Western civilization before the late 1800s, Liberica gained a foothold with Southeast Asian coffee producers after a fungal disease (“coffee rust”) wiped out much of the region's Arabica crops.</dd>
                <dt><b>4. Excelsa Coffee Beans (Coffea excelsa)</b></dt>
                <dd>The fourth major type of coffee bean is called Excelsa. Though it was once considered a separate coffee species, scientists recently reclassified it as a Liberica variant.Excelsa beans grow almost entirely in Southeast Asia, and they're shaped somewhat like Liberica beans — elongated ovals. These beans grow on large 20 to 30-foot coffee plants at medium altitudes.</dd>

                <p>Nescafé is a brand of coffee made by Nestlé. It comes in many different forms. The name is a portmanteau of the words "Nestlé" and "café". Nestlé first introduced their flagship coffee brand in Switzerland on 1 April 1938.
                    Nestlé began developing a coffee brand in 1930, at the initiative of the Brazilian government, to help to preserve the substantial surplus of the annual Brazilian coffee harvest. Max Morgenthaler led the development project. Nestlé introduced the new product under the brand name "Nescafé" on 1 April 1938. Nescafé is a soluble powdered coffee that became an American staple during World War II.
                    In 1965, Nestlé introduced a freeze-dried coffee brand called "Nescafé Gold" in Europe.
                    In 1966, Nestlé developed a freeze-dried coffee brand under the name Taster's Choice.
